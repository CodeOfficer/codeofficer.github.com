    <h1>ShoveBox</h1>
    <p><time>Oct 22, 2008</time></p>
    <p>Over the course of a week, my desktop folder gets pretty messy and I struggle with better ways to manage it. The bulk of my files seem to be xxxxxxx.webloc or text clippings &hellip; for subjects I might be researching but don&rsquo;t care enough about to &ldquo;bookmark&rdquo; forever. The clippings are often relevant for a few hours, but nothing I want to keep around long term. That would be fine enough if I could remember to throw them away after moving onto my next task. Alas, I never do &hellip; my desktop is a disaster!</p>

<p>So, today while in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/werenot">#werenot</a> a good buddy suggested I check out <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">ShoveBox</a>.</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}ShoveBox catches all those little scraps of information that you can&rsquo;t act on now but would rather not forget. It sits up in your menubar, waiting for you to drag in text, images, URLs, and more.&ldquo;
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>Fantastic &hellip; I downloaded the demo, installed it and was left with a great first impression.</p>

<p>In ShoveBox, you are meant to access your scraps via a hotkeyed window ..that was quite important to me. After setting F14-F16 to good use I was glad to see how fast the organizer window loaded. What I want most from this sort of app is for it to be non interruptive, and hotkeys help to that end. Ideally, I won&rsquo;t have to use the mouse at all.</p>

<p>ShoveBox is very simple. You just create folders to store stuff, and then &hellip; you store stuff. You can also flag or label items as you might normally in the Finder, which is helpful. What&rsquo;s best though is that&rsquo;s about as complicated as it gets. I really don&rsquo;t want or expect ShoveBox to do anything more. Thats not to say there aren&rsquo;t additional features, but they don&rsquo;t get in my way. I&rsquo;ve used other apps meant to serve this purpose where that was an issue.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to keep using ShoveBox for a bit longer. My Desktop is clean for now. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>

<p>Anyone else tried apps of this sort? Recommendations?</p>

    <h1>Intridea discovers a great tech community in Portland Maine</h1>
    <p><time>Jun 20, 2009</time></p>
    <p>This week I had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://intridea.com/hackon">Hackon</a>, a FREE 3 day technology event thrown by Intridea here in Portland, Maine. It took place at the <a href="http://www.portlandharborhotel.com/">Portland Harbor Hotel</a> and was organized by <a href="http://www.adambair.com/">Adam Bair</a>, a local friend, Ruby enthusiast and employee of <a href="http://intridea.com/">Intridea</a>. Adam did a wonderful Job of organizing the event. Many thanks to Intridea for making it all possible!</p>

<p>The first 2 days of the event were mostly an open format. Guests brought their laptops and worked off the Hotel&rsquo;s wireless. I honestly don&rsquo;t think I &ldquo;worked&rdquo; very much that 1st day. Instead, I had a wonderful time greeting the attendees, many of whom I had not met before. Surprisingly not everyone was a developer but we had tons to talk about and Day 1 flew by without warning. Thankfully, I did manage to spend most of my time programming on Day 2.</p>

<p>I had a very interesting conversation with <a href="http://fettig.net/about/">Abe Fettig</a>, a Google employee living here in town. He was nice enough to spend a couple hours live coding some Javascript at my request, giving me a great review of prototypal inheritance. I learned so much from our talk. That conversation was really something money couldn&rsquo;t buy and I&rsquo;m still soaking it in! Thanks Abe!</p>

<p>Throughout the event, I discussed with Abe and others a rather complex project I have been working on that makes heavy use of Javascript. I introduced quite a few of these people to <a href="http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/">Sammy</a>, a relatively new jQuery plugin I have decided to use in my project. I am a huge fan of this plugin! It allows you to define Javascript applications as objects attached to your DOM in such a way that makes complicated client side apps easier to manage. Its heavily based on Ruby&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> gem and very easy to use.</p>

<p>Day 3 offered a number of very interesting presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://justbeast.livejournal.com/">Dimitri</a> demonstrated a web framework written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> called Seaside.</li>
<li><a href="http://hackingsearch.com/">Ryan Smith</a> spoke on improving Apache configurations.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tiffanyrad.com/">Tiffany Rad</a> and Nothingface spoke about a VERY cool open source hardware hacking project called <a href="https://secure.area49.net/openotto/">OpenOtto</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://inkfist.com/">Bogart Zalzberg</a> described <a href="http://inkfist.com/postfix_talk/">a humorous story</a> of a poorly configured Postfix installation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am anxious to see if Indridea will host Hackon again next year. I still can&rsquo;t believe this was a free event. In Maine, its so difficult to find the variety and caliber of tech folks that were in attendance in one place. I imagine that <a href="http://techmaine.com/">TechMaine</a> would benefit from hosting similar events.</p>

<p>And oohh look, I guess some <a href="http://gallery.me.com/codeofficer#100071">photos were taken</a> of the event!</p>

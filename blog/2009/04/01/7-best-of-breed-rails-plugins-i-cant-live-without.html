    <h1>7 Best of Breed Rails Plugins I Can't Live Without</h1>
    <p><time>Apr  1, 2009</time></p>
    <p>I am often asked about the various gems/plugins I use in my Rails apps and thought it might make for a good blog post. Most of these I have a good history with, while some I settled on only recently. Either way, this list contains what I consider to be the best of the best, for what each of them helps to accomplish. I hope you will check them out if you have not yet had a chance to.</p>

<h2>REVISIONING</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rich/acts_as_revisable/">acts<em>as</em>revisable</a> (<a href="http://github.com/rich">rich</a>)
A framework for building heavily versioned applications.</p>

<p>acts<em>as</em>revisable is a joy to use. It doesn&rsquo;t have you create separate tables for versions like some other popular versioning plugins. The interface is very well thought out, and I&rsquo;ve yet to find something it doesn&rsquo;t do that I&rsquo;ve needed. Its heavily documented and just works!</p>

<h2>TAGGING</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on/">acts-as-taggable-on</a> (<a href="http://github.com/mbleigh">mbleigh</a>)
A tagging plugin for Rails applications that allows for custom tagging along dynamic contexts.</p>

<p>A tried various tagging solutions over the last year and finally settled on this one by mbleigh. acts-as-taggable-on-steroids and a few others never seemed to work on models build with single table inheritance (STI) or that had polymorphic relationships.</p>

<h2>AUTHENTICATION</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/">authlogic</a> (<a href="http://github.com/binarylogic">binarylogic</a>)
A clean, simple, and unobtrusive ruby authentication solution.</p>

<p>Like most of the Rails community, I earned my stripes using Restful Authentication, a sexy authentication generator that got you up and running in no time at all, but it wasn&rsquo;t long after that I began to find things I didn&rsquo;t like about it. Overall, Restful Authentication felt very non-object oriented. It polluted my user model with code I hadn&rsquo;t written and it didn&rsquo;t even feel restful. Authlogic on the other hand makes no assumptions on how you&rsquo;d like to authenticate users. It lets you treat your UserSession as a model and take advantage of ActiveRecord&rsquo;s build in callbacks. Its also a Gem and easy to update. Nowadays you won&rsquo;t find me using anything else. Its also heavily documented.</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND JOBS</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job/">delayed_job</a> (<a href="http://github.com/tobi">tobi</a>)
Database backed asynchronous priority queue—Extracted from Shopify.</p>

<p>I don’t have a lot of experience with background process plugins, I’ll admit that up front. Hands down though, this one has some slick features and is very actively developed. No complaints.</p>

<h2>GIT WORKFLOW</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/webmat/git_remote_branch/">git<em>remote</em>branch</a> (<a href="http://github.com/webmat">webmat</a>)
A tool to simplify working with remote branches.</p>

<p>If you are a frequent brancher, and need to sync local branches with your remote server there is no better way than using git<em>remote</em>branch. You can publish and track local branches in a single command. I find myself doing this a lot when I have created a branch on my laptop but want to continue where I left off on my other machine at home. It also has a helpful ‘explain’ feature to tell you exactly which commands will run should you use one of its features.</p>

<h2>GEM BUILDING</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/">jeweler</a> (<a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles">technicalpickles</a>)
Simple and opinionated helper for creating and managing Rubygem projects on GitHub.</p>

<p>I knew nothing about writing gems, and pushing them to github &hellip; 20 minutes later I had. Nuff said.</p>

<h2>STATE MACHINES</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine/">state_machine</a> (<a href="http://github.com/pluginaweek">pluginaweek</a>)
Adds support for creating state machines for attributes on any Ruby class.</p>

<p>This one I found by a <a href="http://heypanda.com/">friend’s recommendation</a>. I had been using Rubyist’s Acts As State Machine (now known as AASM) and had many issues with it early on. Specifically I had been trying to cancel a transition in a callback and eventually found out it wasn’t supported. My understanding is that this plugin was originally built for Rails and later refactored to to be less dependent on it. state_machine however was built from day one to work with any Ruby class, and later integrations were added for ActiveRecord, Datamapper and Sequel. Its the best thing out there and I can’t recommend it enough. The code is a joy to look though and its heavily documented.</p>

I haven't posted in a while, but I've been quite busy in other places. I'm hoping to finish up a new Rails blogging engine I've been working on so that I can start writing some advanced ruby/rails tutorials.

This version of Codeofficer.com was thrown together back in my PHP days using an app called Expression Engine. I still think EE is neat software for the average Joe, but as soon as you want to begin creating semi advanced posts with images and such it resists your creativity. Its replacement should be ready soon.

I've more active on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/codeofficer) and [Github](http://github.com/CodeOfficer) otherwise, feel free to follow me there as well.

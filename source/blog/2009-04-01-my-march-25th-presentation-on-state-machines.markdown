[Materials](http://github.com/CodeOfficer/presentation-materials) for a talk I did on March 25th at the Maine Ruby Users Group ([merug.org](http://meruby.org/)) are now on [Github](http://github.com/CodeOfficer). The topic was State Machines and I'll be doing the same presentation again at the New Hampshire Ruby Users Group (nhrug.org) next month, on April 30th.

This was a fun topic for me, and I can't wait to do it again. Thanks to everyone for their kind words afterwards. [Renae Bair](http://twitter.com/renaebair) posted [a great review](http://www.renaebair.com/2009/03/19/ruby-conservation/) of the evening and of the atmosphere of our group in general. Thanks to [Casey Rosenthal](http://dialogues.port49.com/) for his Test Driven presentation on the differences of Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 and for [Nick Hall's](http://ldbss.com/wordpress/) presentation on [Ruby Proce55ing](http://www.processing.org/).

See you all again next month!

I created a more official home for TabsRenderer over at github tonight, and I plan to work on additional helpers this summer in my off-time.

Github is sweet, and I enjoy working with Git so much more lately than Subversion. I usually end up taking my laptop to coffee shops that happen to be without internet (or are charging a fortune ~blasphemy!~) ... when this is the case, its HUGELY beneficial to be able to still commit my work locally even though I do not have a connection to my main repo at home.

So, here's to hoping I get more time to code soon!!

~~~ bash
[codeofficer@Asimov ~/code/git/jquery-ui-rails-helpers]$ git push github master

I've used the [Blueprint CSS](http://blueprintcss.org/) framework on a number of projects and loved it. Recently though, I switched over to using the [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/) for its more minimalist footprint. 960's typography style-sheet contains just enough to get you started on any project, with no extra bloat. I love it.

Blueprint however, does still have a few nice [plugins](http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/wikis/plugins) that I like to use. One such plugin was called [Buttons](http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/tree/master/blueprint%2Fplugins%2Fbuttons), based on the work of [Kevin Hale](http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/). Buttons makes use of the [famfam silk icon set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) that Mark James released to the web community at large under the [Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/).

So this weekend I [built a rails plugin](http://github.com/CodeOfficer/silky-buttons-for-rails/) to incorporate 'Buttons' into my apps. Via a generator command, this plugin will copy the required silk icon set, styles and helper files into your app.

Let me know if you find it useful. [Get it here on Github](http://github.com/CodeOfficer/silky-buttons-for-rails/).

I moved the site last night to a new slice over at [slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com/). I'm psyched to have a new environment to play in. I've been running off a PHP [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com/) installation for a couple years, but that will soon be old news. I've developed a new content creation app for myself and plan to make use of it here. After its launch, I'll be doing some posts to describe how I made it, as I think it may be of interest to others. Anyway just a heads up.
